Below are the steps I took to accomplish my second semester exam: 
- I already have an account with AWS so i used AWS for the deployment
- I created a VPC and subnets on AWS
- I added route tables and internet gateway
- I created two instances on the VPC i created, one master(Ubuntu) and one slave(Debian).
- I made use of the key pair I already had
- I created a security group and set inbound rules to allow port 80 and port 443 for http and https 
- I wrote my playbook following the steps I took for my mini project, converting the commands to ansible modules( This took a lot of googling to achieve)
- I created a project directory on  my master instance where i installed Ansible and all the dependencies i needed, then I deployed the playbook to the slave instance
- I got a free domain name from name cheap (https://ejirolaureld.me) Thanks to github education
- I also found access to a free ssl certificate from [Cerbot](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=apache&os=debiantestin) 
- I finally pushed everything to github and have my fingers crossed waiting to be graded
